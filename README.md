## Features

* **Multi-Target File Broadcasting:** Push files to multiple online devices simultaneously from a single view.
* **Smart Ingestion Paths:** Incoming files are automatically routed to a designated fallback directory (`Download/FileApex`) to keep file systems clean.
* **macOS Finder Integration:** Right-click files directly inside native macOS Finder to broadcast across your local cluster via the Share Extension. 
* **Check for Updates:** Keep your network deployment current with integrated, platform-native updating directly from GitHub releases.


## Local Configuration

Files broadcasted across devices route automatically to the local device storage paths:
* **Android:** `/storage/emulated/0/Download/FileApex/`
* **macOS:** `~/Downloads/FileApex/`

## Privacy & Permissions Disclosures

To provide cross-platform file access and seamless system integration, the app requests the following system permissions and capabilities:

* **File System Access:** Core functionality. Allows the app to navigate, list, and read the user's local directory structure to facilitate remote file management.
* **Unrestricted Battery Usage (Android):** Prevents the OS from aggressively putting the background service to sleep, ensuring the device does not unexpectedly appear "Offline" to connected clients.
* **Internet & External Network Access:** This is strictly **Opt-In**. Used solely to validate Google Account authentication and to safely query for software updates directly from Github.
    * **Strict Privacy Boundary:** No actual files, folders, or personal user data will ever touch Firebase. Firestore will be used strictly as a serverless "virtual registry" to exchange public keys, random device IDs, and local network connection strings. Using Firebase (Google Account) is entirely **Opt-In**.
* **Local Network (LAN) Sockets:** Initiates local network traffic to discover peer devices and stream file data securely between your machines. No personal file data ever leaves your local network.
* **Finder & Share Menu Extensions (macOS):** Integrates directly with the native macOS file manager to provide quick-access context menus and enables sending files to your device pipeline using the system Share menu.
